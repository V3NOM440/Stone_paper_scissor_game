Stone Paper Scissors Game

This is a Python-based implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, where you can play against the computer.
The game allows you to choose from three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and it will randomly generate a choice for the computer. 
The game determines the result of each round and provides feedback on whether you won, lost, or tied.
After each round, you're given the option to play again.

Features:

  Interactive gameplay: The player can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
  Computer opponent: The computer randomly selects its choice each round.
  Result determination: The game informs you if you win, lose, or tie.
  Replay option: Play as many rounds as you'd like without restarting the program.
  Input validation: Handles invalid inputs and prompts the user to try again.
